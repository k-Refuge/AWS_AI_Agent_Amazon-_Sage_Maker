# LexiAgent — AI Legal Assistant for France  
### AWS AI Agent Hackathon 2025  

 **Empowering access to legal and administrative information through AI.**

---

## Overview

**LexiAgent** is an intelligent **LLM-based legal agent** designed for the **AWS AI Agent Hackathon 2025**.  
It helps users — especially foreigners or citizens unfamiliar with a certain country bureaucracy (France as example in our project) — get **clear, accurate, and context-aware answers** to legal and administrative questions such as:

- Residency permits and visa procedures  
- Work contracts and labor law (CERFA forms, rights and obligations)  
- Interactions with public services (Service-Public, Légifrance, etc.)

## The Problem

Finding reliable information about administrative or legal procedures in a new country (France as example in our project) can be **confusing, time-consuming, and fragmented**.  

Even official websites can be difficult to navigate — especially for non-native speakers or people unfamiliar with the country legal jargon.

>  “How can I renew my residency permit in Cergy?”  
>  “Is my employer allowed to terminate my contract during trial period?”  
>  “Which court handles housing disputes?”

These are **real, complex questions** that users ask every day — and our agent is here to answer them, **clearly and accurately**.

---

##  Our Goal

To **democratize access to legal and administrative information** by combining:
- **Language understanding (LLMs)**  
- **Document retrieval** from official sources (Légifrance, Service-Public, Travail-Emploi)  
- **Reasoning and contextual memory**

We aim to **deliver accurate, contextualized, and referenced answers** — bridging the gap between **raw data** and **actionable knowledge**.

##  Inspiration

This project was inspired by our **own experiences as foreign students in France**, navigating complex procedures such as residency permits, labor law, and administrative rights.  

We realized how difficult it is to find **reliable information tailored to one’s personal situation**, so we built a system that does exactly that — and could scale to **other countries** facing similar challenges.
